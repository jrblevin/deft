;;; Commentary:

;; Deft is an Emacs mode for quickly browsing, filtering, and editing
;; directories of plain text notes, inspired by Notational Velocity.
;; It was designed for increased productivity when writing and taking
;; notes by making it fast and simple to find the right file at the
;; right time and by automating many of the usual tasks such as
;; creating new files and saving files.

;; Deft is open source software and may be freely distributed and
;; modified under the BSD license.  Version 0.5.1 is the latest stable
;; version, released on January 28, 2013.  You may download it
;; directly here:

;;   * [deft.el](http://jblevins.org/projects/deft/deft.el)

;; To follow or contribute to Deft development, you can either
;; [browse](http://jblevins.org/git/deft.git) or clone the Git
;; repository:

;;     git clone git://jblevins.org/git/deft.git

;; ![File Browser](http://jblevins.org/projects/deft/browser.png)

;; The Deft buffer is simply a file browser which lists the titles of
;; all text files in the Deft directory followed by short summaries
;; and last modified times.  The title is taken to be the first line
;; of the file and the summary is extracted from the text that
;; follows.  Files are, by default, sorted in terms of the last
;; modified date, from newest to oldest.

;; All Deft files or notes are simple plain text files where the first
;; line contains a title.  As an example, the following directory
;; structure generated the screenshot above.
;;
;;     % ls ~/.deft
;;     about.txt    browser.txt     directory.txt   operations.txt
;;     ack.txt      completion.txt  extensions.txt  text-mode.txt
;;     binding.txt  creation.txt    filtering.txt

;; ![Filtering](http://jblevins.org/projects/deft/filter.png)

;; Deft's primary operation is searching and filtering.  The list of
;; files can be limited or filtered using a search string, which will
;; match both the title and the body text.  To initiate a filter,
;; simply start typing.  Filtering happens on the fly.  As you type,
;; the file browser is updated to include only files that match the
;; current string.

;; To open the first matching file, simply press `RET`.  If no files
;; match your search string, pressing `RET` will create a new file
;; using the string as the title.  This is a very fast way to start
;; writing new notes.  The filename will be generated automatically.
;; If you prefer to provide a specific filename, use `C-RET` instead.

;; To open files other than the first match, navigate up and down
;; using `C-p` and `C-n` and press `RET` on the file you want to open.
;; When opening a file, Deft searches forward and leaves the point
;; at the end of the first match of the filter string.

;; You can also press `C-o` to open a file in another window, without
;; switching to the other window.  Issue the same command with a prefix
;; argument, `C-u C-o`, to open the file in another window and switch
;; to that window.

;; To edit the filter string, press `DEL` (backspace) to remove the
;; last character or `M-DEL` to remove the last "word".  To yank
;; (paste) the most recently killed (cut or copied) text into the
;; filter string, press `C-y`.  Press `C-c C-c` to clear the filter
;; string and display all files and `C-c C-g` to refresh the file
;; browser using the current filter string.

;; For more advanced editing operations, you can also edit the filter
;; string in the minibuffer by pressing `C-c C-l`.  While in the
;; minibuffer, the history of previous edits can be cycled through by
;; pressing `M-p` and `M-n`.  This form of static, one-time filtering
;; (as opposed to incremental, on-the-fly filtering) may be preferable
;; in some situations, such as over slow connections or on systems
;; where interactive filtering performance is poor.

;; By default, Deft filters files in incremental string search mode,
;; where "search string" will match all files containing both "search"
;; and "string" in any order.  Alternatively, Deft supports direct
;; regexp filtering, where the filter string is interpreted as a
;; formal regular expression.  For example, `^\(foo\|bar\)` matches
;; foo or bar at the beginning of a line.  Pressing `C-c C-t` will
;; toggle between incremental and regexp search modes.  Regexp
;; search mode is indicated by an "R" in the mode line.

;; Deft, by default, lists files from newest to oldest.  You can set
;; `deft-current-sort-method' to 'title to sort by file titles, case
;; ignored.  Or, you can toggle sorting method using
;; `deft-toggle-sort-method'.

;; Common file operations can also be carried out from within Deft.
;; Files can be renamed using `C-c C-r` or deleted using `C-c C-d`.
;; New files can also be created using `C-c C-n` for quick creation or
;; `C-c C-m` for a filename prompt.  You can leave Deft at any time
;; with `C-c C-q`.

;; Archiving unused files can be carried out by pressing `C-c C-a`.
;; Files will be moved to `deft-archive-directory', which is a
;; directory named `archive` within your `deft-directory' by default.

;; Files opened with deft are automatically saved after Emacs has been
;; idle for a customizable number of seconds.  This value is a floating
;; point number given by `deft-auto-save-interval' (default: 1.0).

;; Getting Started
;; ---------------

;; To start using it, place it somewhere in your Emacs load-path and
;; add the line

;;     (require 'deft)

;; in your `.emacs` file.  Then run `M-x deft` to start.  It is useful
;; to create a global keybinding for the `deft` function (e.g., a
;; function key) to start it quickly (see below for details).

;; When you first run Deft, it will complain that it cannot find the
;; `~/.deft` directory.  You can either create a symbolic link to
;; another directory where you keep your notes or run `M-x deft-setup`
;; to create the `~/.deft` directory automatically.

;; One useful way to use Deft is to keep a directory of notes in a
;; Dropbox folder.  This can be used with other applications and
;; mobile devices, for example, Notational Velocity or Simplenote
;; on OS X, Elements on iOS, or Epistle on Android.

;; Customization
;; -------------

;; Customize the `deft` group to change the functionality.

;; By default, Deft looks for notes by searching for files with the
;; extension `.txt` in the `~/.deft` directory.  You can customize
;; both the file extension and the Deft directory by running
;; `M-x customize-group` and typing `deft`.  Alternatively, you can
;; configure them in your `.emacs` file:

;;     (setq deft-extension "txt")
;;     (setq deft-directory "~/Dropbox/notes")

;; You can also customize the major mode that Deft uses to edit files,
;; either through `M-x customize-group` or by adding something like
;; the following to your `.emacs` file:

;;     (setq deft-text-mode 'markdown-mode)

;; Note that the mode need not be a traditional text mode.  If you
;; prefer to write notes as LaTeX fragments, for example, you could
;; set `deft-extension' to "tex" and `deft-text-mode' to `latex-mode'.

;; If you prefer `org-mode', then simply use

;;     (setq deft-extension "org")
;;     (setq deft-text-mode 'org-mode)

;; For compatibility with other applications which take the title from
;; the filename, rather than from first line of the file, set the
;; `deft-use-filename-as-title' flag to a non-nil value. To enable this
;; functionality, simply add the following to your `.emacs` file:

;;     (setq deft-use-filename-as-title t)

;; Below changes the default behavior for creating new files when the filter
;; is non-empty: the filter string will be used to generate the new filename
;; If `deft-use-filename-as-title' is `nil', the string will be inserted as
;; title into the document.

;;     (setq deft-use-filter-string-for-filename t)

;; If `deft-use-filter-string-for-filename' is `nil' (default), file name will
;; be auto generated with a common prefix like `deft-' and incrementing numbers
;; following the prefix. Example: `deft-0.EXT', `deft-1.EXT', ..

;; You can easily set up a global keyboard binding for Deft.  For
;; example, to bind it to F8, add the following code to your `.emacs`
;; file:

;;     (global-set-key [f8] 'deft)

;; Deft also provides a function for opening files without using the
;; Deft buffer directly.  Calling `deft-find-file' will prompt for a
;; file to open, just like `find-file', but starting from
;; `deft-directory'.  If the file selected is in `deft-directory', it
;; is opened with the usual deft features (using `deft-text-mode',
;; automatic saving, automatic updating of the Deft buffer, etc.).
;; Otherwise, the file will be opened by `find-file' as usual.
;; Therefore, you can set up a global keybinding for this function to
;; open Deft files anywhere.  For example, to use `C-x C-g`, a
;; neighbor of `C-x C-f`, use the following:

;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-g") 'deft-find-file)

;; The faces used for highlighting various parts of the screen can
;; also be customized.  By default, these faces inherit their
;; properties from the standard font-lock faces defined by your current
;; color theme.

;; Incremental string search is the default method of filtering on
;; startup, but you can set `deft-incremental-search' to nil to make
;; regexp search the default.

;; The title of each file is taken to be the first line of the file,
;; with certain characters removed from the beginning (hash
;; characters, as used in Markdown headers, and asterisks, as in Org
;; Mode headers).  The substrings to remove are specified in
;; `deft-strip-title-regexp'.

;; More generally, the title post-processing function itself can be
;; customized by setting `deft-parse-title-function', which accepts
;; the first line of the file as an argument and returns the parsed
;; title to display in the file browser.  The default function is
;; `deft-strip-title', which removes all occurrences of
;; `deft-strip-title-regexp' as described above.

;; Acknowledgments
;; ---------------

;; Thanks to Konstantinos Efstathiou for writing simplnote.el, from
;; which I borrowed liberally, and to Zachary Schneirov for writing
;; Notational Velocity, whose functionality and spirit I wanted to
;; bring to Emacs.

;; History
;; -------

;; Version 0.5.1 (2013-01-28):

;; * Bug fix: creating files with `C-c C-n` when both the filter string and
;;   `deft-use-filename-as-title' are non-nil resulted in an invalid path.
;; * Bug fix: killed buffers would persist in `deft-auto-save-buffers'.

;; Version 0.5 (2013-01-25):

;; * Implement incremental string search (default) and regex search.
;;   These search modes can be toggled by pressing `C-c C-t`.
;; * Default search method can be changed by setting `deft-incremental-search'.
;; * Support custom `deft-parse-title-function' for post-processing titles.
;; * The default `deft-parse-title-function' simply strips occurrences of
;;   `deft-strip-title-regexp', which removes Markdown and Org headings.
;; * Open files in another window with `C-o`.  Prefix it with `C-u` to
;;   switch to the other window.
;; * For symbolic links, use modification time of taget for sorting.
;; * When opening files, move point to the end of the first match of
;;   the filter string.
;; * Improved filter editing: delete (`DEL`), delete word (`M-DEL`),
;;   and yank (`C-y`).
;; * Advanced filter editing in minibuffer (`C-c C-l`).

;; Version 0.4 (2011-12-11):

;; * Improved filtering performance.
;; * Optionally take title from filename instead of first line of the
;;   contents (see `deft-use-filename-as-title').
;; * Dynamically resize width to fit the entire window.
;; * Customizable time format (see `deft-time-format').
;; * Handle `deft-directory' properly with or without a trailing slash.

;; Version 0.3 (2011-09-11):

;; * Internationalization: support filtering with multibyte characters.

;; Version 0.2 (2011-08-22):

;; * Match filenames when filtering.
;; * Automatically save opened files (optional).
;; * Address some byte-compilation warnings.

;; Deft was originally written by [Jason Blevins](http://jblevins.org/).
;; The initial version, 0.1, was released on August 6, 2011.
