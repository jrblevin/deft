;;; Commentary:

;; Deft is an Emacs mode for quickly browsing, filtering, and editing
;; directories of plain text notes, inspired by Notational Velocity.
;; It was designed for increased productivity when writing and taking
;; notes by making it fast and simple to find the right file at the
;; right time and by automating many of the usual tasks such as
;; creating new files and saving files.

;; Obtaining Deft
;; --------------

;; Deft is open source software and may be freely distributed and
;; modified under the BSD license.  The latest stable release is
;; version 0.7, released on December 21, 2015.

;; **Installation via MELPA Stable**

;; The recommended way to install Deft is to obtain the stable version
;; from [MELPA Stable](https://stable.melpa.org/#/deft) using
;; `package.el'.  First, configure `package.el' and the MELPA Stable
;; repository by adding the following to your `.emacs', `init.el', or
;; equivalent startup file:

;;     (require 'package)
;;     (add-to-list 'package-archives
;;                  '("melpa-stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/"))
;;     (package-initialize)

;; Then, after restarting Emacs or evaluating the above statements, issue
;; the following command: `M-x package-install RET deft RET`.

;; [MELPA Stable]: http://stable.melpa.org/

;; **Direct Download**

;; Alternatively you can manually download and install Deft.
;; First, download the latest stable version of and save the file
;; where Emacs can find it---a directory in your `load-path':

;;   * [deft.el](http://jblevins.org/projects/deft/deft.el)

;; Then, add the following line to your startup file:

;;     (require 'deft)

;; **Development Version**

;; To follow or contribute to Deft development, you can browse or
;; clone the Git repository [on GitHub](https://github.com/jrblevin/deft):

;;     git clone https://github.com/jrblevin/deft.git

;; If you prefer to install and use the development version, which may
;; become unstable at some times, you can either clone the Git
;; repository as above or install Deft from
;; [MELPA](https://melpa.org/#/deft).

;; If you clone the repository directly, then make sure that Emacs can
;; find it by adding the following line to your startup file:

;;     (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/deft/repository")

;; Overview
;; --------

;; The Deft buffer is simply a file browser which lists the titles of
;; all text files in the Deft directory followed by short summaries
;; and last modified times.  The title is taken to be the first line
;; of the file and the summary is extracted from the text that
;; follows.  Files are, by default, sorted in terms of the last
;; modified date, from newest to oldest.

;; All Deft files or notes are simple plain text files where the first
;; line contains a title.  As an example, the following directory
;; structure generated the screenshot above.
;;
;;     % ls ~/.deft
;;     about.txt    browser.txt     directory.txt   operations.txt
;;     ack.txt      completion.txt  extensions.org
;;     binding.txt  creation.txt    filtering.txt
;;
;;     % cat ~/.deft/about.txt
;;     # About
;;
;;     An Emacs mode for slicing and dicing plain text files.

;; Deft's primary operation is searching and filtering.  The list of
;; files can be limited or filtered using a search string, which will
;; match both the title and the body text.  To initiate a filter,
;; simply start typing.  Filtering happens on the fly.  As you type,
;; the file browser is updated to include only files that match the
;; current string.

;; To open the first matching file, simply press `RET`.  If no files
;; match your search string, pressing `RET` will create a new file
;; using the string as the title.  This is a very fast way to start
;; writing new notes.  The filename will be generated automatically.
;; If you prefer to provide a specific filename, use `C-RET` instead.

;; To open files other than the first match, navigate up and down
;; using `C-p` and `C-n` and press `RET` on the file you want to open.
;; When opening a file, Deft searches forward and leaves the point
;; at the end of the first match of the filter string.

;; You can also press `C-o` to open a file in another window, without
;; switching to the other window.  Issue the same command with a prefix
;; argument, `C-u C-o`, to open the file in another window and switch
;; to that window.

;; To edit the filter string, press `DEL` (backspace) to remove the
;; last character or `M-DEL` to remove the last "word".  To yank
;; (paste) the most recently killed (cut or copied) text into the
;; filter string, press `C-y`.  Press `C-c C-c` to clear the filter
;; string and display all files and `C-c C-g` to refresh the file
;; browser using the current filter string.

;; For more advanced editing operations, you can also edit the filter
;; string in the minibuffer by pressing `C-c C-l`.  While in the
;; minibuffer, the history of previous edits can be cycled through by
;; pressing `M-p` and `M-n`.  This form of static, one-time filtering
;; (as opposed to incremental, on-the-fly filtering) may be preferable
;; in some situations, such as over slow connections or on systems
;; where interactive filtering performance is poor.

;; By default, Deft filters files in incremental string search mode,
;; where "search string" will match all files containing both "search"
;; and "string" in any order.  Alternatively, Deft supports direct
;; regexp filtering, where the filter string is interpreted as a
;; formal regular expression.  For example, `^\(foo\|bar\)` matches
;; foo or bar at the beginning of a line.  Pressing `C-c C-t` will
;; toggle between incremental and regexp search modes.  Regexp
;; search mode is indicated by an "R" in the mode line.

;; Common file operations can also be carried out from within Deft.
;; Files can be renamed using `C-c C-r` or deleted using `C-c C-d`.
;; New files can also be created using `C-c C-n` for quick creation or
;; `C-c C-m` for a filename prompt.  You can leave Deft at any time
;; with `C-c C-q`.

;; Unused files can be archived by pressing `C-c C-a`.  Files will be
;; moved to `deft-archive-directory', which is a directory named
;; `archive` within your `deft-directory' by default.

;; Files opened with deft are automatically saved after Emacs has been
;; idle for a customizable number of seconds.  This value is a floating
;; point number given by `deft-auto-save-interval' (default: 1.0).

;; Getting Started
;; ---------------

;; Once you have installed Deft following one of the above methods,
;; you can simply run `M-x deft` to start Deft.  It is useful
;; to create a global keybinding for the `deft' function (e.g., a
;; function key) to start it quickly (see below for details).

;; When you first run Deft, it will complain that it cannot find the
;; `~/.deft` directory.  You can either create a symbolic link to
;; another directory where you keep your notes or run `M-x deft-setup`
;; to create the `~/.deft` directory automatically.

;; One useful way to use Deft is to keep a directory of notes in a
;; Dropbox folder.  This can be used with other applications and
;; mobile devices, for example, [nvALT][], [Notational Velocity][], or
;; [Simplenote][] on OS X or [Editorial][], [Byword][], or [1Writer][]
;; on iOS.

;; [nvALT]: http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/
;; [Notational Velocity]: http://notational.net/
;; [Simplenote]: http://simplenote.com/
;; [Editorial]: https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/editorial/id673907758?mt=8&uo=6&at=11l5Vs&ct=deft
;; [Byword]: https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/byword/id482063361?mt=8&uo=6&at=11l5Vs&ct=deft
;; [1Writer]: https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/1writer-note-taking-writing/id680469088?mt=8&uo=6&at=11l5Vs&ct=deft

;; Basic Customization
;; -------------------

;; You can customize items in the `deft` group to change the default
;; functionality.

;; By default, Deft looks for notes by searching for files with the
;; extensions `.txt`, `.text`, `.md`, `.markdown`, or `.org` in the
;; `~/.deft` directory.  You can customize both the file extension and
;; the Deft directory by running `M-x customize-group` and typing
;; `deft`.  Alternatively, you can configure them in your `.emacs`
;; file:

;;     (setq deft-extensions '("txt" "tex" "org"))
;;     (setq deft-directory "~/Dropbox/notes")

;; The first element of `deft-extensions' (or in Lisp parlance, the
;; car) is the default extension used to create new files.

;; By default, Deft only searches for files in `deft-directory' but
;; not in any subdirectories.  All files in `deft-directory' with one
;; of the specified extensions will be included except for those
;; matching `deft-ignore-file-regexp'.  Set `deft-recursive' to a
;; non-nil value to enable searching for files in subdirectories
;; (those not matching `deft-recursive-ignore-dir-regexp'):

;;     (setq deft-recursive t)

;; You can easily set up a global keyboard binding for Deft.  For
;; example, to bind it to F8, add the following code to your `.emacs`
;; file:

;;     (global-set-key [f8] 'deft)

;; If you manage loading packages with [use-package][], then you can
;; configure by adding a declaration such as this one to your init
;; file:

;;     (use-package deft
;;       :bind ("<f8>" . deft)
;;       :commands (deft)
;;       :config (setq deft-directory "~/Dropbox/notes"
;;                     deft-extensions '("md" "org")))

;; [use-package]: https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package

;; Reading Files
;; -------------

;; The displayed title of each file is taken to be the first line of
;; the file, with certain characters removed from the beginning.  Hash
;; characters, as used in Markdown headers, and asterisks, as in Org
;; Mode headers, are removed.  Additionally, Org mode `#+TITLE:` tags,
;; MultiMarkdown `Title:` tags, LaTeX comment markers, and
;; Emacs mode-line declarations (e.g., `-*-mode-*-`) are stripped from
;; displayed titles.  This can be customized by changing
;; `deft-strip-title-regexp'.

;; More generally, the title post-processing function itself can be
;; customized by setting `deft-parse-title-function', which accepts
;; the first line of the file as an argument and returns the parsed
;; title to display in the file browser.  The default function is
;; `deft-strip-title', which removes all occurrences of
;; `deft-strip-title-regexp' as described above.

;; For compatibility with other applications which use the filename as
;; the title of a note (rather than the first line of the file), set the
;; `deft-use-filename-as-title' flag to a non-`nil' value.  Deft will then
;; use note filenames to generate the displayed titles in the Deft
;; file browser.  To enable this, add the following to your `.emacs` file:

;;     (setq deft-use-filename-as-title t)

;; Finally, the short summary that is displayed following the file
;; title can be customized by changing `deft-strip-summary-regexp'.  By
;; default, this is set to remove certain org-mode metadata statements
;; such as `#+OPTIONS:` and `#+AUTHOR:'.

;; Creating Files
;; --------------

;; Filenames for newly created files are generated by Deft automatically.
;; The process for doing so is determined by the variables
;; `deft-use-filename-as-title' and `deft-use-filter-string-for-filename'
;; as well as the rules in the `deft-file-naming-rules' alist.
;; The possible cases are as follows:

;; 1.  **Default** (`deft-use-filename-as-title' and
;;     `deft-use-filter-string-for-filename' are both `nil'):
;;
;;     The filename will be automatically generated using an short,
;;     ISO-like timestamp as in `2016-05-12T09:00.txt'.  The format
;;     can be customized by setting the variable
;;     `deft-new-file-format'.  The filter string will be inserted as
;;     the first line of the file (which is also used as the display
;;     title).  In case of file name conflicts, an underscore and a
;;     numerical suffix (e.g., `_2') will be appended before the
;;     extension.

;; 2.  **Filenames as titles** (`deft-use-filename-as-title' is non-`nil'):

;;     When `deft-use-filename-as-title' is non-`nil', the filter string
;;     will be used as the filename for new files (with the appropriate
;;     file extension appended to the end).  An example of new file creation
;;     in this case:

;;       * Filter string: "My New Project"
;;       * File name: "My New Project.txt"
;;       * File contents: [empty]

;; 3.  **Readable filenames** (`deft-use-filename-as-title' is
;;     `nil' but `deft-use-filter-string-for-filename' is non-`nil'):

;;     In this case you can choose to display the title as parsed from
;;     the first line of the file while also generating readable
;;     filenames for new files based on the filter string.  The
;;     variable `deft-use-filter-string-for-filename' controls this
;;     behavior and decouples the title display
;;     (`deft-use-filename-as-title') from the actual filename.  New
;;     filenames will be generated from the filter string and
;;     processed according to the rules defined in the
;;     `deft-file-naming-rules' alist.  By default, slashes are removed
;;     and replaced by hyphens, but many other options are possible
;;     (camel case, replacing spaces by hyphens, and so on).  See the
;;     documentation for `deft-file-naming-rules' for additional
;;     details.

;;     As an example, with the following value for
;;     `deft-file-naming-rules', Deft will replace all slashes and
;;     spaces with hyphens and will convert the file name to
;;     lowercase:

;;         (setq deft-file-naming-rules
;;               '((noslash . "-")
;;                 (nospace . "-")
;;                 (case-fn . downcase)))

;;     Below is an example in this case, with the above file naming
;;     rules.  Notice that the filter string is inserted as the first
;;     line of the file but it is also used to generate a "readable"
;;     file name.

;;       * Filter string: "My New Project"
;;       * File name: "my-new-project.txt"
;;       * File contents: "My New Project"

;; Titles inserted into files from the filter string can also be
;; customized for two common modes, `markdown-mode' and `org-mode', by
;; setting the following variables:

;; * `deft-markdown-mode-title-level' - When set to a positive
;;   integer, determines how many hash marks will be added to titles
;;   in new Markdown files.  In other words, setting
;;   `deft-markdown-mode-title-level' to `2` will result in new files
;;   being created with level-2 headings of the form `## Title`.

;; * `deft-org-mode-title-prefix' - When non-nil, automatically
;;   generated titles in new `org-mode' files will be prefixed with
;;   `#+TITLE:`.

;; Other Customizations
;; --------------------

;; Deft, by default, lists files from newest to oldest.  You can set
;; `deft-current-sort-method' to 'title to sort by file titles, case
;; ignored.  Or, you can toggle sorting method using
;; `deft-toggle-sort-method'.

;; Incremental string search is the default method of filtering on
;; startup, but you can set `deft-incremental-search' to nil to make
;; regexp search the default.

;; Deft also provides a function for opening files without using the
;; Deft buffer directly.  Calling `deft-find-file' will prompt for a
;; file to open, much like `find-file', but limits consideration to
;; files in `deft-directory' that are known to Deft (i.e., those files
;; matching `deft-extensions`).  Unlike `find-file`, a list of all
;; such files is provided and the desired file name can be completed
;; using `completing-read' (and, as a result, `deft-find-file` will
;; read/complete filenames using ido, helm, etc.  when enabled).  If
;; the selected file is in `deft-directory', it is opened with the
;; usual Deft features (automatic saving, automatic updating of the
;; Deft buffer, etc.).  Otherwise, the file will be opened by
;; `find-file' as usual.  Therefore, you can set up a global
;; keybinding for this function to open Deft files anywhere.  For
;; example, to use `C-x C-g`, a neighbor of `C-x C-f`, use the
;; following:

;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-g") 'deft-find-file)

;; The faces used for highlighting various parts of the screen can
;; also be customized.  By default, these faces inherit their
;; properties from the standard font-lock faces defined by your current
;; color theme.

;; Deft also provides several hooks: `deft-mode-hook',
;; `deft-filter-hook', and `deft-open-file-hook'.  See the
;; documentation for these variables for further details.

;; which I borrowed liberally, and to Zachary Schneirov for writing
;; Notational Velocity, whose functionality and spirit I wanted to
;; bring to Emacs.

;; History
;; -------

;; Version 0.7 (2015-12-21):

;; * Add custom regular expression `deft-strip-summary-regexp' for
;;   stripping extraneous text for generating the summary line.  Strip
;;   all `org-mode' metadata by default.
;; * New customizable regular expressions for ignoring files and
;;   directories.  See `deft-recursive-ignore-dir-regexp' and
;;   `deft-ignore-file-regexp'.
;; * Bug fix: Prevent lines from wrapping in console mode.
;; * Bug fix: Setup `deft-extensions` and `deft-default-extension` at
;;   load time.
;; * Bug fix: Try to prevent false title matches in org-mode notes
;;   where the string `#+TITLE:` might also appear in the body.
;; * Bug fix: Use `with-current-buffer` instead of `save-excursion`
;;   while auto-saving files since we do not want to save the point.
;; * Bug fix: Don't escape quotes in `deft-file-naming-rules'.

;; Version 0.6 (2015-06-26):

;; * Recursive search in subdirectories (optional).  Set
;;   `deft-recursive' to a non-nil value to enable.
;; * Support for multiple extensions via the `deft-extensions' list.
;;   As such, `deft-extension' is now deprecated.
;; * New variable `deft-create-file-from-filter-string' can enable
;;   generation of new filenames based on the filter string.  This decouples
;;   the title display (`deft-use-filename-as-title') from the actual filename
;;   generation.
;; * New variable `deft-file-naming-rules' allows customizing generation
;;   of filenames with regard to letter case and handling of spaces.
;; * New variables `deft-markdown-mode-title-level' and
;;   `deft-org-mode-title-prefix' for automatic insertion of title markup.
;; * Archiving of files in `deft-archive-directory'.
;; * Ability to sort by either title or modification time via
;;   `deft-current-sort-method'.
;; * Update default `deft-strip-title-regexp' to remove the following:
;;     - org-mode `#+TITLE:` tags
;;     - MultiMarkdown `Title:` tags
;;     - LaTeX comment markers
;;     - Emacs mode-line declarations (e.g., `-*-mode-*-`)
;; * Remove leading and trailing whitespace from titles.
;; * Disable visual line mode to prevent lines from wrapping.
;; * Enable line truncation to avoid displaying truncation characters.
;; * Show the old filename as the default prompt when renaming a file.
;; * Call `hack-local-variables' to read file-local variables when
;;   opening files.
;; * Fixed several byte-compilation warnings.
;; * Bug fix: more robust handling of relative and absolute filenames.
;; * Bug fix: use width instead of length of strings for calculations.
;; * Bug fix: fix `string-width' error with empty file.

;; Version 0.5.1 (2013-01-28):

;; * Bug fix: creating files with `C-c C-n` when both the filter string and
;;   `deft-use-filename-as-title' are non-nil resulted in an invalid path.
;; * Bug fix: killed buffers would persist in `deft-auto-save-buffers'.

;; Version 0.5 (2013-01-25):

;; * Implement incremental string search (default) and regexp search.
;;   These search modes can be toggled by pressing `C-c C-t`.
;; * Default search method can be changed by setting `deft-incremental-search'.
;; * Support custom `deft-parse-title-function' for post-processing titles.
;; * The default `deft-parse-title-function' simply strips occurrences of
;;   `deft-strip-title-regexp', which removes Markdown and Org headings.
;; * Open files in another window with `C-o`.  Prefix it with `C-u` to
;;   switch to the other window.
;; * For symbolic links, use modification time of taget for sorting.
;; * When opening files, move point to the end of the first match of
;;   the filter string.
;; * Improved filter editing: delete (`DEL`), delete word (`M-DEL`),
;;   and yank (`C-y`).
;; * Advanced filter editing in minibuffer (`C-c C-l`).

;; Version 0.4 (2011-12-11):

;; * Improved filtering performance.
;; * Optionally take title from filename instead of first line of the
;;   contents (see `deft-use-filename-as-title').
;; * Dynamically resize width to fit the entire window.
;; * Customizable time format (see `deft-time-format').
;; * Handle `deft-directory' properly with or without a trailing slash.

;; Version 0.3 (2011-09-11):

;; * Internationalization: support filtering with multibyte characters.

;; Version 0.2 (2011-08-22):

;; * Match filenames when filtering.
;; * Automatically save opened files (optional).
;; * Address some byte-compilation warnings.

;; Deft was originally written by [Jason Blevins](http://jblevins.org/).
;; The initial version, 0.1, was released on August 6, 2011.

  "Alist of cons cells (SYMBOL . VALUE) for `deft-absolute-filename'.

Supported cons car values: `noslash', `nospace', `case-fn'.

Value of `slash' is a string which should replace the forward
slash characters in the file name.  The default behavior is to
replace slashes with hyphens in the file name.  To change the
replacement charcter to an underscore, one could use:

   (setq deft-file-naming-rules '((noslash . \"_\")))

Value of `nospace' is a string which should replace the space
characters in the file name.  Below example replaces spaces with
underscores in the file names:

   (setq deft-file-naming-rules '((nospace . \"_\")))

Value of `case-fn' is a function name that takes a string as
input that has to be applied on the file name.  Below example
makes the file name all lower case:

   (setq deft-file-naming-rules '((case-fn . downcase)))

It is also possible to use a combination of the above cons cells
to get file name in various case styles like,

snake_case:

    (setq deft-file-naming-rules '((noslash . \"_\")
                                   (nospace . \"_\")
